## A tool for rapidly creating presentations and prototypes of user experiences. ##

Whitespace is a tool for creating and testing interactive concepts. It enables designers to work in their graphic application of choice while creating an initially linear click-through of their product's core scenarios. As ideas become more developed you can add more interactivity using Adobe Flash. And as the functional design becomes solid, you can move from wireframes to a final high-fidelity presentation with complete look-and-feel.

### The core value of Whitespace is the seemless transition from early sketching and storyboarding to a non-linear interactive prototype. Also, Whitespace is unique in its approach to collabrative prototyping, allowing multiple designers and developers to work at the same time on one prototype. ###

As a presentation tool, it is ideal for presenting your work to your team or to clients, because you can move seemlessly from presenting your message (in a typical slideshow presentation) to showing a working example of your design.

Here is a list of the existing features
  * Automatically discovers numerically ordered PNG and SWF files and presents them as a click-through (simply update these files to make changes instantly)
  * Simulate transition states as animation by naming a file with the "T" or "TRANSITION" identifier in the filename
  * Share common graphics by referencing non-order files in the filename (ie. "bg", or "nav")
  * Record and view "Click-clues" at runtime (without opening Flash) to remind yourself or a presenter where to click for a particular screen (holding Shift places a spotlight on the place you click to proceed).
  * Define interactive navigation between states with history (back navigation) in Flash without writing any code.
  * View help screen at any time by pressing the ?/ Key.

Whitespace is an Adobe AIR application, and the current sample included with the source requires that you build it in Flash using the AIR extensions in order to run it. If you need the standalone Flash SWF version of this email me and I'll get a copy of it to you with instructions on how to use it: nathan at artefactgroup dot com

Whitespace is very early in its development. Your patience, suggestions, and contributions are greatly appreciated.
